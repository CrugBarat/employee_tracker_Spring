# Employee Tracker

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

## Brief

In this lab please use what youâ€™ve already learned about Spring to create an entirely new Spring application that allows you to get the details of an employee.

**MVP**

Create a Spring Boot application for recording employee data that has:

- An Employee class that conforms to POJO and is annotated with fields name, age, employeeNumber and email
- A repository for doing database operations
- A RestController with one route for getting a JSON list of all Employees
